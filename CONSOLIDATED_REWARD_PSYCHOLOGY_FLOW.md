## 1. Core Psychology Framework & Flow

### Primary User Journey
```
Daily Work → Performance Tracking → Points Accumulation → Conversion Trigger → Game Selection → Play Experience → Prize Receipt → Social Recognition → Motivation Reinforcement
```

### Psychological Principles Applied
1. **Variable Ratio Reinforcement**: Unpredictable but consistent rewards (most engaging pattern)
2. **Progressive Achievement**: Visible tier progression with escalating benefits
3. **Social Recognition**: Peer acknowledgment and team-based competitions
4. **Competence Building**: Skills transfer between work performance and gaming success

### Neurochemical Engagement Points
- **Dopamine**: Anticipation (pre-game), achievement (wins), progress (tier advancement)
- **Serotonin**: Belonging (team achievements), recognition (leaderboards)
- **Oxytocin**: Social sharing, collaborative celebrations

## 2. Tiered Progression System

### Tier Structure & Requirements
| Tier | Days Active | Games Played | Performance Avg | Key Benefits |
|------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Bronze** | 30 | 5+ | Any | Basic games, 35% win rate, 1-10 pt prizes |
| **Silver** | 90 | 25+ | 60%+ | All standard games, 38% win rate, 5-25 pt prizes, early lunch |
| **Gold** | 180 | 100+ | 75%+ | Premium games, 42% win rate, 10-50 pt prizes, cash $5-25, PTO |
| **Platinum** | 365 | 200+ | 85%+ | Exclusive games, 45% win rate, 25-100 pt prizes, cash $25-100, vacation |

### Advancement Flow
```
Performance Review → Tier Calculation → Advancement Check → Celebration & Bonuses → Updated Access & Benefits
```

## 3. Points-to-Games Conversion Mechanics

### Dynamic Conversion Algorithm
```python
# Psychological conversion system
base_threshold = TIER_THRESHOLDS[tier_level]

# Performance modifiers (key psychological element)
if recent_performance > 85:
    threshold = base_threshold * 0.8  # 20% easier (reward high performers)
elif recent_performance < 60:
    threshold = base_threshold * 1.2  # 20% harder (encourage improvement)

# Variable ratio reinforcement (prevents predictability)
variance = random.uniform(0.7, 1.3)
final_threshold = int(threshold * variance)
```

### Conversion Decision Tree
```
Points Earned → Tier Check → Performance Modifier → Random Factor (0.7-1.3x) → Threshold Reached? → Game Unlock/Continue Earning
```

## 6. Fairness & Economic Balance

### Company Protection Mechanisms
```python
def adjust_reward_economics(budget_usage, performance_metrics):
    if budget_usage > 0.85:
        return "conservative_mode"  # Reduce prizes, maintain rates
    elif performance_metrics["productivity"] > 1.15:
        return "generous_mode"      # Increase rewards
    else:
        return "standard_mode"      # Normal operations
```

### Budget Control Flow
```
System Monitoring → Budget Check (>85%?) → Conservative Mode OR Performance Check (>115%?) → Generous Mode OR Standard Mode → Apply Adjustments
```

### Employee Fairness Features
- **Transparent Odds**: Clear probability communication
- **Multiple Earning Paths**: Various routes to game access beyond points
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Alternative descriptions for gambling-concerned employees
- **Appeal Process**: Review system for perceived unfairness

## 7. Technical Implementation Roadmap

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- New tables needed:
- employee_tiers (tier tracking, progression)
- conversion_thresholds (dynamic conversion rates)  
- achievements (performance & gaming milestones)
- employee_achievements (individual progress tracking)
- game_sessions (psychology-enhanced session data)
- social_interactions (peer engagement tracking)
```

### Enhanced Existing Tables
```sql
-- Add psychology columns to employees:
- consecutive_play_days, last_play_date
- pity_timer_count, comeback_bonus_eligible  
- preferred_game_type

-- Add psychology columns to mini_games:
- tier_level, psychology_trigger
- session_id, conversion_cost
```

### Core Psychology Engine Class
```python
class PsychologyEngine:
    - calculate_employee_tier()
    - update_employee_tier()  
    - calculate_conversion_threshold()
    - handle_tier_advancement()
    - record_achievement()
```
