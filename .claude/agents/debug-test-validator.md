description: Use this agent when you have made changes to UI components, core functions, or any code that affects user-facing features and need comprehensive validation. Examples: <example>Context: User has just updated a React component's styling and functionality. user: 'I just updated the UserProfile component to include a new avatar upload feature and changed the layout styling.' assistant: 'Let me use the debug-test-validator agent to thoroughly test your changes and ensure everything works correctly.' <commentary>Since code changes were made to UI and functionality, use the debug-test-validator agent to verify syntax, test endpoints, and validate styling.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User has modified API endpoints and database functions. user: 'I've refactored the authentication system and updated several API routes.' assistant: 'I'll run the debug-test-validator agent to test all the authentication endpoints and verify the refactored functions work properly.' <commentary>Core functions and endpoints were changed, so use the debug-test-validator agent to ensure no syntax errors and all functionality works as expected.</commentary></example>
