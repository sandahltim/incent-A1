## 1. Psychology of Rewards Framework

### Core Psychological Principles

#### Variable Ratio Reinforcement Schedule
- **Most Addictive Pattern**: Rewards given unpredictably but consistently
- **Application**: Points-to-games conversion uses variable thresholds
- **Healthy Balance**: Predictable base rewards with surprise bonuses

#### Progression & Achievement
- **Flow State Maintenance**: Challenges scale with skill level
- **Status Recognition**: Visible tier progression (Bronze → Silver → Gold)
- **Competence Building**: Skills transfer between work and game performance

#### Social Dynamics
- **Peer Recognition**: Leaderboard integration with gaming achievements
- **Team Competition**: Department-based challenges and rewards
- **Mentorship**: Higher-tier employees can share game opportunities

### Neurochemical Engagement

#### Dopamine Release Patterns
1. **Anticipation**: Pre-game excitement and suspense
2. **Achievement**: Win confirmation and prize reveal  
3. **Progress**: Tier advancement and streak bonuses
4. **Social**: Leaderboard position changes

#### Serotonin & Oxytocin
- **Belonging**: Team-based achievements and shared celebrations
- **Recognition**: Public acknowledgment of wins and progress
- **Contribution**: Individual success benefits team metrics

## 2. Points-to-Games Conversion Mechanics

### Dynamic Conversion System

#### Base Conversion Rates (Variable)
```
Tier Level | Base Points Required | Range Variation
Bronze     | 25-35 points       | ±40% variance
Silver     | 20-28 points       | ±30% variance  
Gold       | 15-22 points       | ±25% variance
Platinum   | 12-18 points       | ±20% variance
```

#### Conversion Triggers

**Primary Triggers:**
- **Performance Milestones**: Reaching certain point thresholds
- **Streak Bonuses**: Consecutive high-performance periods
- **Seasonal Events**: Holiday bonuses and company celebrations
- **Achievement Unlocks**: Completing specific work objectives

**Secondary Triggers:**
- **Time-Based**: Weekly/monthly automatic conversions
- **Peer Nominations**: Colleagues can "gift" game opportunities
- **Manager Awards**: Supervisor discretionary bonuses
- **Recovery Assists**: Help struggling employees stay engaged

### Conversion Algorithm

```python
def calculate_game_conversion(employee_points, tier_level, recent_performance):
    base_threshold = TIER_THRESHOLDS[tier_level]
    
    # Apply performance modifiers
    if recent_performance > 85:
        threshold = base_threshold * 0.8  # 20% easier
    elif recent_performance < 60:
        threshold = base_threshold * 1.2  # 20% harder
    else:
        threshold = base_threshold
    
    # Add randomness for variable ratio reinforcement
    variance = random.uniform(0.7, 1.3)
    final_threshold = int(threshold * variance)
    
    return employee_points >= final_threshold
```
